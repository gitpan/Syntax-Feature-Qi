NAME
    Syntax::Feature::Qi - Remove the same indendation from all lines

SYNOPSIS
        use syntax 'qi';

        say qs{
            This is a sub routine:
            sub printme {
                print shift;
            }
        };

        # is exactly the same as

        say qs{
        This is a sub routine:
        sub printme {
            print shift;
        }
        };

DESCRIPTION
    This is a syntax extension to be used with syntax.

    It provides two quote-like operators, "qi" and "qqi". They are drop-in
    replacements for "q" and "qq", respectively.

    They work like this: First they find the first line in the string with a
    non-white space character. It saves the white space from the beginning
    of that line up to that character, and then it tries to remove the exact
    same whitespace from all other lines in the string.
